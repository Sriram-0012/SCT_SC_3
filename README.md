# Task 3 â€“ Sudoku Solver

This is my third task as a Software Engineering Intern at Skillcraft Technology.

The program takes a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle and solves it using the backtracking algorithm.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Backtracking
- Recursion

## How to Run
1. Save the code in a file called `sudoku_solver.py`
2. Run the file using: `python sudoku_solver.py`

## What I Learned
- How to use recursion and backtracking
- How Sudoku solving works using logic
- How to write clean and structured code in Python
